It's cliche to make resolutions as one year ends and another begins, as if this time is somehow special - different compared to every other week of the year in making goals stick. As much as it is a cliche, I want to see if there's any merit to not only setting my goals this time of the year, but to being open about what I'm reaching toward. Here's my question: 
> "Will being public about my goals help keep me accountable to them?"

I've been making resolutions for a long time. But the real question is: will I **really** put in the time, effort, and prioritization to make those goals come to life? How many will I end up dropping in favor of binging on entertainment? Netflix and chill, web novel marathons, bottomless Sunday brunches?

Out of my 20 year long laundry list of personal and career aspirations, and bucket list of adventures I aim to get to in the next year, how much will I get to?

Hey, sometimes life happens, not a big deal. But me thinks hitting 80% of my goals is fair game. 

So let's play a new game this year: let's sign up publicly for what I want to do. And let's do it.
