## public resolutions

It's cliche to make resolutions as one year ends and another begins, as if this time is somehow special - different compared to every other week of the year in making goals stick. For that, I'm cliche. But I am going to try something different this time around. Question: Will being public about my goals help keep my accountable to them? 

Goal setting is nothing new to me. I set goals every quarter, sometimes every month. I have a spreadsheet with two dozen recipes I aim to cook, sorted by expected value (difficulty x taste). I have a model of my earnings, savings, and life milestones for the next twenty years assuming I want children and early retirement. I have a bucket list of key results I aim to hit in the next year to make life exciting (see: worth living), including running a marathon, becoming fluent in french, and getting to 15% body fat.

The real question is: will I *really* put in the time, effort, and prioritization to make those goals come to life? How many will I end up dropping in favor of binging on entertainment? Netflix and chill, web novel marathons, bottomless Sunday brunches?

Hey, sometimes life happens, not a big deal. But me thinks hitting 80% of my goals is fair game. 

So let's play a new game this year: let's sign up publicly for what I want to do. And let's do it.
