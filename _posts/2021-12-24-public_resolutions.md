It's cliche to make resolutions as one year ends and another begins, as if this time is somehow special - different compared to every other week of the year in making goals stick. So sue me as I embrace the cliche. But I **am** going to try something different this time around. Here's a question: 
> "Will being public about my goals help keep me accountable to them?"

Goal setting is nothing new to me. I set new life goals on the monthly. Take a look at sheets.google.com, and you'll find personal and career milestones for the next twenty years. You'll find a bucket list of adventures I aim to get to in the next year.

The real question is: will I **really** put in the time, effort, and prioritization to make those goals come to life? How many will I end up dropping in favor of binging on entertainment? Netflix and chill, web novel marathons, bottomless Sunday brunches?

Hey, sometimes life happens, not a big deal. But me thinks hitting 80% of my goals is fair game. 

So let's play a new game this year: let's sign up publicly for what I want to do. And let's do it.
