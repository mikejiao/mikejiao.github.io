Interested in high growth products, meaningful social change, and beautiful, immersive experiences

### Work
Product Manager at [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)

Reddit is home to thousands of communities, endless conversation, and authentic human connection. It's a fascinating and magical place on the internet where 50M+ daily users come to be part of something special on r/wallstreetbets, r/SkincareAddiction, r/askhistorians, and more.

My focus is on driving user growth via helping people understand and stay connected to the value of Reddit.
